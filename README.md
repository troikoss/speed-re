# SPEED RE

An unofficial reverse-engineering project for EA Black Box's **SPEED** engine.
The final goal is verified, reproducibly buildable source for the engine. To keep
the scope small, **Need for Speed Underground 2, PC v1.2** is the first target
and the reference build for all evidence here. The current Linux driving demo is
an intermediate milestone; this is an incomplete decompilation.

## You must provide the game files

**Game assets and the retail executable are not supplied by this project. You
must provide them from your own lawfully obtained PC installation of Need for
Speed Underground 2.** Cloning this repository does not provide a copy of the game.

The demo reads car models, track data, textures, HUD packages, and other required
files from your installation. It also requires the supported PC v1.2
`speed2.exe`: the current runtime checks its SHA-256 and maps reference data
from it. No original instructions execute in the native demo. Keep the game's
directory structure intact and pass its installation root with `--game`.
Both build variants below require these files.

Do not commit or distribute retail assets, executables, compiler binaries, or
generated disassembly with this project. Local `build/`, `orig/`, and `local/`
directories are ignored. Game files remain the property of their respective
rights holders; this repository grants no license to them.

## Build without the mod loader

The native targets require a multilib C++ compiler and i386 SDL2/OpenGL
libraries and development headers. Native scaffolding uses C++11. The current
build includes host-specific Linux include/library paths; see
[the native demo notes](docs/NATIVE_DEMO.md) for setup and limitations.
These commands build the current demo and analysis executables, not a completed
reconstruction of the entire game.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/native -DUG2_ENABLE_MODDING=OFF
cmake --build build/native
build/native/ug2demo --game "/path/to/Need for Speed Underground 2" --car SKYLINE
```

`UG2_ENABLE_MODDING=OFF` is the default. This build does not include the native
mod loader or its example plugins.

## Build with the mod loader

Use a separate build directory to keep both variants available:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/modding -DUG2_ENABLE_MODDING=ON
cmake --build build/modding
build/modding/ug2demo --game "/path/to/Need for Speed Underground 2" --car SKYLINE --width 1920 --height 1080
```

This builds the native loader and example plugins. Plugins and their
`load_order.txt` are placed in `build/modding/mods`. The supplied order enables
`original_physics` (which forwards to the recovered solver) and `widescreen_hud`.
By default, the loader looks for `mods` beside the executable. Edit
`load_order.txt` to select active plugins, or choose another directory:

```sh
build/modding/ug2demo --game "/path/to/Need for Speed Underground 2" --mods-dir "/path/to/mods" --car SKYLINE
```

To run the loader-enabled build with all mods disabled:

```sh
build/modding/ug2demo --game "/path/to/Need for Speed Underground 2" --no-mods --car SKYLINE
```

Optional installation of the hosts, SDK, and examples:

```sh
cmake --install build/modding --prefix "/path/to/install"
```

Installation does not copy game files. See [the modding guide](modding/README.md)
for plugin layout, SDK rules, load order, and verification instructions.

## How to mod the demo

The current plugin API targets the rebuilt 32-bit Linux demo. It does not load
these plugins into the retail Windows game. Native plugins run inside the host
process without a sandbox; use plugins you trust.

### Install and enable plugins

Build with `UG2_ENABLE_MODDING=ON`, then place each plugin in its own folder
under the executable's `mods` directory:

```text
build/modding/mods/
    load_order.txt
    original_physics/plugin.so
    widescreen_hud/plugin.so
    my_mod/plugin.so
```

Add one plugin ID per line in `load_order.txt`, in the order you want them loaded:

```text
original_physics
widescreen_hud
my_mod
```

The folder name must match the plugin's descriptor ID. IDs accept ASCII letters,
digits, `_`, and `-`, up to 80 characters. Blank lines and `#` comments are
accepted. Remove or comment out a line to disable that plugin; unlisted folders
are inactive. Restart the demo after changing plugins or load order. A missing
order file runs without mods. Libraries must be 32-bit ELF shared objects.

The bundled `widescreen_hud` plugin adjusts driving HUD anchors and horizontal
field of view for wide screens. The bundled `original_physics` plugin delegates
to the recovered solver. Callbacks run in load order; the last successfully
initialized physics provider wins. Use `--no-mods` to disable all plugins.

### Create a plugin

Use [the SDK header](modding/sdk/ug2_mod_api.h) and start from
[the HUD example](modding/examples/widescreen_hud/plugin.cpp) for presentation
changes or [the forwarding physics example](modding/examples/original_physics/plugin.cpp)
for physics-provider integration.

1. Copy an example into your own `plugin.cpp` and change its descriptor ID to
   `my_mod`. Keep its exported `ug2_mod_query` entry point, C linkage, and
   `UG2_CALL`/`UG2_EXPORT` declarations.
2. Register callbacks or a provider through the host API in initialization.
   Use the documented API rather than modifying recovered layouts directly.
3. Compile from the repository root with the SDK include path:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p build/modding/mods/my_mod
   c++ -std=c++11 -m32 -fPIC -shared -fvisibility=hidden \
       -I modding/sdk /path/to/my_mod/plugin.cpp \
       -o build/modding/mods/my_mod/plugin.so
   ```

4. Add `my_mod` to `build/modding/mods/load_order.txt`, then launch the
   loader-enabled demo with your game installation using the command above.

Keep descriptor and callback storage alive until unload, match the SDK API
version and structure sizes, and do not let C++ exceptions cross API calls.
Do not link recovered game libraries into plugins. Render callbacks must
restore graphics state. The stable API supports HUD translation, projection
adjustments, lifecycle callbacks, and physics-provider integration; an in-game
mod manager, Lua support, hot reload, and dependency resolution are not yet
implemented. See [the full SDK guide](modding/README.md) for callback timing,
ownership rules, physics contracts, and validation commands.

## Demo controls and status

The demo drives a stock car on the L4RA streets with recovered vehicle,
collision, camera, and HUD routines. SDL2 window/input handling, OpenGL drawing,
and documented integration seams are platform scaffolding.

Controls: W/S throttle and brake, hold S at rest to reverse, A/D steering,
Space handbrake, R reset, C cycle camera, hold V to look back, and Esc quit.
See [native demo notes](docs/NATIVE_DEMO.md) for options and known limitations.

The default game directory is `Need for Speed Underground 2` relative to the
working directory. `UG2_EXE`, where supported by analysis tools, selects the
reference executable for verification; the demo uses `--game` instead.

Some functions byte-match the reference executable; others have bounded
original/rebuilt execution comparisons and remain nonmatching. Many routines
and integration paths still require verification. A playable demo or the
presence of a source file does not establish complete recovery or equivalence.
Behavioral verification and byte matching are reported separately.
Start with [the documentation index](docs/README.md) and
[the decompilation scope](docs/DECOMPILATION_SCOPE.md).

## Local verification

```sh
python -m venv build/venv
build/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-pc-analysis.txt
UG2_EXE="/path/to/Need for Speed Underground 2/speed2.exe" build/venv/bin/python tools/verify_pc_wheel_math.py
```

Verification also requires locally supplied MSVC 7.1 and wibo; string matching
uses delink and objdiff. These tools and compiler binaries are not bundled.
Run MSVC/wibo jobs sequentially because they share temporary filenames.
See the subsystem documentation for verifier-specific setup and limitations.
