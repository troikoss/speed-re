# Native vehicle demo

A 32-bit native Linux build now drives a UG2 car using the recovered vehicle
sources end to end. This playable demo is an intermediate milestone,
not completion of the decompilation. Recovered routines in this pass are
reconstructed from disassembly but are **not yet behaviour-verified** against the
original by differential execution, except for the isolated comparisons in
[vehicle recovery](pc-vehicle-physics.md), [wheel/body verification](pc-wheel-physics.md),
and the compression evidence below. Recovery-pass labels describe implementation
history, not independent verification levels.

## What runs as recovered UG2 code

The full PhysicsMover update chain from `0x5b72d0`:

- Construction: mover `0x5b5cc0`, body `0x5a7f30`/`0x59b940`/`0x43c7c0`, wheel
  `0x5a8160`, suspension arm `0x5a86c0`, engine `0x5aa5a0`/`0x457b00`, drivetrain
  `0x5af9d0` with shift points `0x5ac7d0`, inline Ackermann steering and aero objects,
  initial placement `0x5a48a0`.
- Pre-steps: load refresh `0x5ab990` (centre `0x5a60f0`, mount `0x59e0c0`, centre move
  `0x59b8b0`), mode refresh `0x5a49a0` (response scale `0x599170`, slip `0x591d90`),
  control transfer `0x5abbf0` with gear selection `0x5aa960`/`0x5a1700`/`0x594f20`/
  `0x594670`, brake/grip distribution `0x5a4d80` with traction factor `0x5990c0`, launch
  assist `0x5b6300`.
- Substeps: integrator `0x5aa480` (earlier verified), orthonormalisation `0x5bb0d0`.
- Post-integration `0x5b04d0`/`0x5a0d80`: block post-updates (wheel `0x59d030`, arm
  `0x5a8790` with ground query `0x59d250`, surface noise `0x5d3ca0`), rest handling
  `0x5abb00`/`0x5a5e20`/`0x5992b0`, bump stop `0x59e1a0`, limited impulse `0x59bc60`.
- Controller forces `0x5b0520`: aero `0x59e620`, wheel contact `0x59d160`, the earlier
  verified coupling/drivetrain/engine chain, yaw assist `0x5ac260`, wheel lift
  `0x5a51b0`, remote correction `0x5a5c20`, guide force `0x5ecf70`.
- State export `0x5a5540` (origin `0x592400`, wheel render frames `0x5921b0` with
  rotation helpers `0x5bac90`/`0x5bada0`/`0x5bae60`), state reset `0x59f880`, nitrous
  timers `0x591cd0`/`0x592480`/`0x5925b0`/`0x592500`/`0x59fa30`.
- Car-object queries: `0x5ed290`, `0x5ed470`, `0x5ebfa0`, `0x5ed220`, `0x5ed1b0`,
  `0x5ebf60`, `0x5ee250`, `0x5ec790`, `0x5f67f0`, `0x592870`, draft/ambient
  `0x5ed5d0`/`0x61e380`/`0x6134e0`/`0x5f0b40`, helpers `0x401020`, `0x43c370`,
  `0x43c390`, `0x43cf90`, `0x440f70`, `0x5eb8f0`/`0x5eb900`/`0x5eb910`.
- Static initializers that build vehicle curves (`0x77de60`..`0x77ed80`), found with
  `tools/list_pc_static_initializers.py`.

All 50 physics sources compile with MSVC 7.1 (`/Ox /Ob0`), and every partial layout
carries compile-time offset checks (`Ug2Layout.h`). No routine in this list is counted
as byte-matching.

## Track collision (second pass)

The demo now drives on UG2's L4RA streets using recovered world-collision code in
`src/Speed/Indep/Src/World/WCollision.cpp`:

- Collision manager `0x88f768` (constructor `0x5e81d0`), chunk handler `0x5e78a0` for
  per-section packs `0x80034130` and barrier groups `0x3412f`, pack fixup `0x5d8140`,
  registration `0x5e6980`, section index `0x5d3c10`, lookup `0x591380`.
- Face cache `0x5d8350`, expansion `0x5d7f10`/`0x5d2cc0`, fetch `0x5e0c90`, eviction
  `0x5dcad0`/`0x5dca70`/`0x5d82c0`, edge test `0x5d3330`.
- Per-car collider (car `+0x5c4`): constructor `0x5e0b40`, release/area `0x5dc9c0`/
  `0x5d80a0`/`0x5e5890`, pack switching `0x5e6890`/`0x5e68d0`, and the ground query
  `0x5e72e0` (cached faces, 32 m cells, 8 m sub-cell masks, fixed-point bounds).
- Section topology `0x883e70` (chunk `0x80034150`, loader `0x5e9c10`), tracker
  `0x5dfeb0`, section search `0x5db850`/`0x5db770`, polygon tests `0x5d6dd0`,
  `0x5d7090`, `0x5d7270`, `0x5d70d0`.
- Skid-mark emitter `0x59dbb0` with rotation helper `0x59db50`.

The skid-mark trail methods (`0x5e6e70`, `0x5d3230`) are a renderer seam: the demo
records segments to draw them. Wall collision is recovered in the fifth pass below; the
demo still respawns a car that leaves the collision coverage (scaffolding).

## Wall collision (fifth pass)

Cars now collide with the track's walls through UG2's collision-body world, recovered in
`src/Speed/Indep/Src/Physics/Collision/` (class names from the original slot pools and
serialisation strings). Walls are not special-cased: every frame each moving body turns
the track faces near it into `TrackPolygonCollisionBody` objects, pairs overlapping bodies,
measures pairs with GJK and resolves touching pairs with an impulse.

- World step `0x5ffa50` (after `0x5f0f00` advances every dynamic body), stale pairs
  `0x592e60`, pair search `0x5b23b0` over the body list kept sorted by maximum X
  (`0x5a0680`, largest width `0x5a05a0`), contact list sort `0x43bee0`/`0x5a0eb0`/`0x5a0dc0`,
  contact removal `0x5af090`, orphan polygons `0x5a0cd0`, pools `0x5a0200`/`0x593db0`/`0x592b00`.
- Bodies: `CollisionBody` `0x5a04f0`/`0x5a9c00`, `DynamicCollisionBody` `0x5a9ce0` (pose
  snapshot `0x593210`, interpolated pose `0x593280`, rewind `0x593630`/`0x593590`, mover
  attach `0x5938c0`, shape extents `0x5ae520`, bounds `0x5a9de0`, polygon reach `0x5937b0`,
  polygon spawning `0x5ae930`), `CarCollisionBody` `0x5aec20` with slots `0x593b40`..`0x5a0be0`
  (impulse `0x5a0b00` → `MoverBody` `0x59bd80`, inverse mass/inertia `0x593a00`/`0x593a40`,
  restitution/friction `0x5a0c90`/`0x5a0be0`, shape choice `0x5a0a80`), `TrackPolygonCollisionBody`
  `0x5aa0b0`/`0x5aefa0` with its fixed-body slots and polygon shape `0x5a1a90`.
- Track faces near a body: collider area update `0x5e7100`, area fill `0x5e0d30`, planar
  face distance `0x5d3450`; car hulls from `CARS/<car>/GEOMETRY.BIN` chunk `0x80034020`
  (`0x5a1750`, lookup `0x5a18c0`, key = model name + `_CV`), falling back to the box `0x598760`.
- Shapes: vertices `0x5aad20`/`0x5a1970`/`0x5a2010`/`0x5987d0`, support points (hull hill
  climbing `0x5afba0`, polygon `0x5a2060`, box `0x5a2280`, point `0x5a2360`).
- Pair witness `0x5a0340`/`0x5b22b0`, shapes `0x598590`, poses `0x598620`, distance update
  `0x5b3d20`, GJK `0x5b3390` with the feature-pair sub-algorithm `0x595040` and simplex copies
  `0x598130`/`0x598240`, pair test `0x5b5050`, thick-polygon flags `0x592f00`/`0x593010`.
- Contacts: impact time bisection `0x5b4be0`, separation `0x5b42f0`, polygon normal side
  `0x593df0`, contact frame `0x594000`, resolve `0x5b2610` (rewind, impulse, re-advance),
  impulse with restitution and friction `0x5af0e0`/`0x5941c0`.
- Contact events (the mover's "contact bodies"): `0x5a9b10`/`0x5a9430`/`0x5a9570`/`0x5ae470`,
  lookup `0x5a0820`, wall/floor tests `0x5a0160`/`0x5a01b0`, accumulation part of `0x5a9620`.
- World clock `0x57a0e0` (60 Hz frames, 4 kHz ticks at `0x86518c`), which ages the events.

Verification: `tools/verify_pc_collision_simplex.py` runs the original and the MSVC 7.1
rebuild of `0x595040`/`0x598130`/`0x598240` in Unicorn on 6,400 synthetic simplices. All
non-degenerate cases agree within float rounding (about two thirds bit-identical); 42
cases with duplicated or collinear vertices pick a different vertex at an exact tie
because of x87 spill rounding. Nothing here is byte-matching; the rest is behaviour
observed in the demo only. In the headless run with `UG2_STEER=-0.4` the Skyline hits
walls at 71 and 90 km/h, loses roughly half its speed, and its centre stays 1.2 to 2.3 m
in front of the wall plane.

Scaffolding and seams (`src/Platform/Native/NativeCollision.cpp`): the car update `0x6012b0`
is reduced to the mover step; collision effects after the impulse sums (sparks, sounds,
replay, force feedback), audio registration `0x483e20`/`0x483e40` and the game message
`0x5e0360` are no-ops; the hull key `0x61c320` is computed by the loader for stock parts;
slot pools are the recovered bWare pools ([slot pool evidence](pc-bware-slotpool.md)) over a
calloc-backed heap seam; the world clock runs after the
step (its original call site is not recovered). World objects (type 1/2), cylinders,
replay serialisation and mover point velocity (`0x59bec0`) are trapped. `UG2_DEBUG_COLLISION=1`
prints every impulse with the wall normal and the car's distance to the wall plane.

## Original assets (third pass)

The demo now draws UG2's own car and track data from the player's installation instead of
placeholder boxes and collision polygons.

Recovered and behaviour-verified (`tools/verify_pc_compression.py`): the bWare
decompressors in `src/Speed/Indep/Libs/bWare/Compression.cpp`, namely dispatcher
`0x574670`, JDLZ `0x573700`, HUFF wrapper `0x5744c0` with the EA Huffman decoder
`0x573840`, and RAWW `0x5744f0`. All 2,404 compressed slots of the Skyline, shared car and
Skyline vinyl texture packs decode byte-for-byte like the original running in Unicorn,
including 64 guard bytes after each output. The sources compile with MSVC 7.1; they are not
counted as byte-matching. The COMP decoder `0x574530` is not recovered.

Asset reading and drawing (`NativeAssets.cpp`, `NativeScene.cpp`) is platform scaffolding.
The original loaders (`0x493bb0`, `0x494ea0`, `0x5cc280`) are not recovered. The data
layouts used, checked on the retail files:

- Solid (`0x80134010`): header `0x134011` with the full-name hash at `+0x10` (stored names
  are cut to 27 characters, so parts are matched by hash) and bounds at `+0x20`/`+0x30`;
  texture slots `0x134012`; platform info `0x134900` with the vertex count at `+0x34`;
  vertices `0x134b01` (128-aligned, 36-byte position/normal/colour/UV on cars, 24-byte
  position/colour/UV on 98% of track solids); 60-byte draw records `0x134b02` (index count
  `+0xc`, texture slot `+0x1c`, start `+0x34`, flags `+0x38`); 16-bit indices `0x134b03`.
- Texture pack (`0xb3300000`): `0x33310004` holds 0x7c-byte TextureInfo records after a
  fixed 12-byte pad (name, hash `+0x18`, data offset `+0x24`, palette offset `+0x28`, size
  `+0x2c`, width/height `+0x38`, compression `+0x3e`: 0x08 palette, 0x20 BGRA, 0x22/0x24/
  0x26 DXT1/3/5). Pixel data starts at the `0x33320002` payload aligned to 0x80. Car packs
  instead list 24-byte `0x33310003` slots (hash, file offset, packed size, size, TextureInfo
  distance from the end) of JDLZ/HUFF payloads holding pixels followed by the TextureInfo.
- Scenery section (`0x80034100`): `0x34102` 0x44-byte infos (name, LOD solid hashes at
  `+0x20`/`+0x24`); `0x34103` 0x40-byte instances (bounds, info index in the low half and
  flags in the high half of `+0x18`, position `+0x20`, int16 rotation rows at `+0x2c` with
  0x2000 = 1). All 48,270 L4RA instances resolve to loaded solids. The section number
  is at `0x34101` `+0xc` (letter `n / 100 + 0x40`, number `n % 100`).

### Scenery visibility (fourth pass)

Read from the original and applied by the demo (behaviour, not byte matching):

- Visible sections, `0x5e96b0`: the drivable section whose boundary holds the eye
  (`0x5e00d0`: bounds test `0x43d410`, even-odd crossing test `0x5d6dd0`) supplies a list
  of section numbers; the Z sections 2600-2699 (SKYDOME) are always added. With no
  drivable section the loaded sections numbered below 10 are used. The data is
  `0x80034150` in `L4RA.BUN`, loaded by `0x5e9c10`: `0x34151` header, `0x34152` boundaries
  (section `+0x8`, point count `+0xa`, bounds `+0xc`/`+0x14`, x/y points from `+0x24`),
  `0x34153` 0xa4-byte drivable records (section `+0x8`, count `+0x10`, sections from
  `+0x14`). The nearest-boundary fallback `0x5db770` is not recovered.
  Drawing every section put the low-detail panoramas (`PAN_*`, sections X9x) over the
  detailed scenery: that was the smeared ground and the black rectangle.
- View flags, view setup `0x4888a0`: `view +0x44` is 0x10 always, 0x08/0x04 by
  `0x89e7a4` (0 for the forward direction), 0x02 for eView `+4` types 1/2, 0x01 when
  `0x8707dc` is 3 or 4, 0x40 for 0x1800 (mirror) views, 0x20 for type 3. The per-instance
  test in `0x5d6570` skips an instance when `(instance +0x1a ^ 0x60) & (byte)view +0x44`;
  the demo uses 0x18 for the player view. Instances flagged 0x10 (race barriers, shop
  beams, start/finish graphics) are therefore hidden in every view.
- Instance flag 0x100 queues the model with no matrix (its vertices are in world space).
- Scenery is reached through the `0x34104` 0x24-byte tree nodes (bounds, child count
  `+0x18`, up to five children; negative entries are nodes), traversed by `0x5d69b0`.
  Every L4RA instance is reachable, so the demo walks the instance array.

Scaffold render states (the D3D renderer is not recovered): TextureInfo `+0x49` reads as
alpha usage (0 none, 1 punch-through, 2 modulated) and `+0x4a` as blend type (0 none,
1 blended, 2 additive), judged from how they are spread across L4RA's textures. Blend
type 0 draws opaque and alpha-tests only punch-through textures, so the alpha of road and
terrain textures (modulated, used as a mask) is ignored. Types 1 and 2 are drawn after
the opaque pass without depth writes. Extra texture packs: `TRACKS/LOC4DYNTEX.BIN`
(SKYDOME), `GLOBAL/InGameCommon.bun` (SFX_LIGHT_BEAMA), `GLOBAL/GLOBALB.BUN` and
`GLOBAL/GlobalTexturesNA.bin`. The sky dome is drawn scaled about the eye because it is
wider than the demo's far plane, and the clear colour is a fixed dusk tone.

Debug aids: `UG2_DEBUG_AT="x y"` lists the instances whose bounds hold a point,
`UG2_DEBUG_PICK="x y"` names the scenery instance drawn at a screenshot pixel (top-left
origin, final frame; it redraws into the stencil buffer), and `UG2_DEBUG_SECTIONS=1`
prints the drivable section and its visible list whenever it changes.

The stock car is `<CAR>_BASE_A` plus the KIT00 parts of LOD A. The generic texture keys
those parts use are the replacement keys built by CarRenderInfo `0x638190` and the
used-texture setup `0x631e20`, resolved with lights off and no damage: `WINDOW_*`,
`DRIVER` → `DRIVER_MALE` (the in-game branch of `0x638190`), `BRAKELIGHT_LEFT/RIGHT` →
`<CAR>_KIT00_BRAKELIGHT_OFF`, `BRAKELIGHT_CENTRE` → `<CAR>_CENTRE_BRAKELIGHT_OFF`. Scaffold
choices: windows bind GLOBALB's `WINDOW`; the paint/vinyl layers (`<CAR>_SKIN1` and the
unnamed body-panel and skirt keys `0x3c84d757`/`0xa7366ae6`) are drawn in a fixed colour;
lighting is fixed-function OpenGL. The wheel model is drawn at the recovered wheel render
frames (`0x5921b0`), mirrored for right-side wheels.

## Drive camera and HUD (fifth pass)

Recovered and applied by the demo (behaviour, not byte matching; `DriveCamera.cpp` and `HudGauge.cpp`
compile with MSVC 7.1 `/Ox /Ob0`):

- **Drive camera**, the mover Player::SetCameraState (`0x5f1fd0`) builds for state 1: constructor
  `0x451660`, update `0x453570`, pose `0x44de90`, setting read `0x445eb0`, car frame `0x445e00`.
  Eye, look-at and up are cubic Hermite followers (`0x5749e0`/`0x574df0`, restarted on every target
  change, duration from the dynamics key) in car-local axes. Targets come from the per-car camera
  table at CarTypeInfo `+0x720` (GLOBALB.BUN: six 16-byte `{type, angle, x, height, lateral}`
  entries, types 0 far, 1 close, 2 bumper, 3 driver, 4 hood, 5 super far; option to type map
  `0x502500`) plus the 4-frame average of the car acceleration (`car +0x80`) scaled and clamped by the
  static dynamics curve table `0x7ec610` sampled at the constant `0x787154`. Field of view per type
  is the table `0x7eb5b4` (71.5 degrees chase, 90 cockpit); near plane 0.5 (0.4 driver); projection
  from `0x5c7ec0` (half-angle tangents from the field of view and the 1.1 / 0.8696 aspect constants).
  Bumper and driver types hide the car (Camera `+0x280`). Keys: `C` cycles far/close/hood/bumper,
  `V` looks back (hold); `--camera N` picks the profile option 0..4 (default 3, outside far).
- **HUD**: `HUD_SingleRace.fng` from `GLOBAL/InGameFreeRoam.bun`. FNG layout (package `FEn\xe7`:
  `PkHd`, `TypS`, `Res\xcc` with `RsNm`/`RsRq` (50 six-dword requests, name hash, name offset,
  kind), `Obj\xcc` with `FOb\xea` blocks of `ObjD` 16-bit tag/size records and `Scrp` scripts) is read
  from the loaders `0x5554a0`/`0x555140`/`0x5515e0`/`0x518380`. Object state block: colour (B, G, R, A
  dwords), pivot, position, rotation quaternion, size and for images UVs. Position `OP +0xc` low half is
  the resource index, `PA` the parent GUID, flag bit 0 hides (`0x50ca00`/`0x50ca50`). Coordinates are
  640x480 with the origin at the screen centre; lower z draws in front. Object hashes are the case
  folded `h = h * 33 + c` (`0x505450`) of names found in the executable (`3rdPersonNeedle`,
  `3rdPersonSpeed`, `3rdPersonGear`, ...). The gauge feature is the recovered `0x4f5100`/`0x4c68d0` (`HudGaugeFeature::Update` in
  `HudFreeroam.cpp`):
  dial type `0x60fe10` (7500..10500 scale), needle sweep `(maximum rpm / scale) * 235` degrees, needle
  angle `0x4aa0e0`, speed `|v| * 2.237` mph or `* 3.6` km/h, gear characters from `0x7f66a4`, gear
  colour while shifting, skin textures `TACH_FILL_CUSTOM_nn`, `3RDPERSON_*LINES_CUSTOM_nn` and
  `3RDPERSON_RPMDIAL_CUSTOM_nn` from `HUD_CustomTextures_ALL.bin` (`--hud-skin N`, 0 default), unit
  text `MPH`/`KM/H` by hash from `LANGUAGES/English.bin` (`--metric`).

Scaffolding in this pass: the FEng object model and renderer (`NativeFng.cpp`), UI text (see
[UI fonts](#ui-fonts)), the acceleration vector at car
`+0x80` (its original producer is not recovered; it is the change of the exported velocity per second,
inferred from its camera use and from `0x5ec3a0` dotting it with the forward axis), the player
record and its camera mover (`NativePlayer.h`: one player bound at vehicle creation in
`0x8900ac`/`0x8900b4`, car `+0xc` set to its CarTypeInfo record; a stand-in kind-1 chase mover
at `+0x238` because the camera is native, whose type-change slot `+0x20` leaves the switch to the
native camera), and the controller
call without a player argument (so the rear-view mirror view `0x5f1e10` is not created).
Recovered `0x600090` produces the masks and recovered `0x4ca090` applies them; laps and
`tach_fill` colouring remain seams.
The full gauge update `0x4c68d0` (speed, needle, gear, shift light), turbo and NOS updates are
now recovered; the demo's `--metric` choice is written to the profile option `0x83aa1a`. Region/cash/reward
widgets accept external career state; their visibility follows the recovered masks
(cash needs career mode `0x850078` = 1, which the demo leaves 0). The bank balance is stored at the
original `0x861e74` and read by recovered `0x500f90`; the native loader publishes
language 0 (English) at `0x7f70d0` for recovered `0x4ff970`. GPS, heat and notification scheduling have bounded source
verification but are not live native features. Message-script playback supports
retained noncycling vector/colour tracks with recovered arithmetic. Complete NOS
stencil rendering and full FEng scripts remain unresolved; see
[freeroam HUD evidence](pc-hud-freeroam.md).
The minimap uses recovered `0x4ca840`, TrackInfo record 4000, `TRACKMAP4000.BIN`,
and the retail map/mask/north/player objects. Its border group follows recovered
mask application `0x4c6690` and recursive FEng show/hide `0x50ca50`/`0x50ca00`;
native free drive supplies mask bit 0. Its native pool setup and OpenGL
RGB/stencil mask rendering remain platform seams; see [minimap evidence](pc-hud-minimap.md).

Not recovered, left as seams: world collision pushes for the chase types (`0x444530`, `0x44b040`),
camera shake (`0x452ed0`, `0x572a50`), Camera object finalisation (`0x447280`), the cockpit blocked
tests (`0x445fc0`, `0x5d39f0`), the chase heading follower (`0x445c20`, only read by a subclass), the
replay RPM source and HUDINDEX option.

## Pause menu (sixth pass)

`Esc` opens UG2's pause menu over the frozen game. The menu logic is the recovered
`PauseFNGObject` (`src/Speed/Indep/Src/Frontend/PauseMenu.cpp`, constructor `0x4eb410`, handler
`0x4c2170`, option lists `0x4c2900`/`0x4c2bd0`, item `React` handlers), verified separately in
[pause menu evidence](pc-pause-menu.md). In the demo's free drive (`0x89e7b0` = 0, game mode
`0x850078` = 0, both untouched .bss) it builds Return to Free Run, Options, Replay (disabled: no
replay data, so navigation skips it) and Quit to Main Menu. Left/right (or A/D) move, Enter/Space
selects, Esc/Backspace goes back.

Data: `UI_Pause.fng` and `UI_InGameDialog.fng` are not plain `0x30203` packages; they are
`0x30210` chunks in `GLOBAL/InGameCommon.bun` holding the package-name hash (`0x505450`) and a JDLZ
block, unpacked with the recovered decompressor. Textures come from `InGameCommon.bun` (icons) and
`GLOBALB.BUN` (menu frames). Script `EV` records (12 bytes: message, target, milliseconds) are now
read; `UI_Pause.fng`'s `FORWARD` script sends `EXIT_COMPLETE` (`0xe1fde1d1`) to the package at
320 ms, which completes back, resume and the non-dialog items.

Seams in `src/Platform/Native/NativePause.cpp` (scaffolding, behaviour as read, not verified):

- Remaining IconScroller base construction/dispatch (`0x552330`, `0x543d40`):
  icons fill `option_1..n` 40 units apart,
  anchored on the hidden `OPTION_MASTER`; unselected icons are drawn at 0.8 and centre aligned
  by recovered `0x52f8c0`, shown inside a 480-unit window (`0x50d9c0`); moves skip disabled icons without
  wrapping using recovered `0x51f9f0`; accept reacts immediately for dialog items (`+0x45`) and after
  `EXIT_COMPLETE` otherwise, only for the focused icon object (`0x50d980`). Scroll animation now uses recovered tweening;
  sounds and Dim/UNDIM scripts are not modelled.
- Deferred message storage `0x50da20` and input stop/start `0x52fbf0`/`0x52fba0`
  now call recovered code, including the original package-mask writes. Native
  input gates use scroller +0x2f; owner stopped state lives at +0x14c. Full input
  dispatch and package membership remain seams. See [bounded evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#scroller-deferred-messages-and-input-masks-2026-10-18).
- Icon construction `0x51f670`, insertion `0x543c10` and owner wrapper `0x50dab0`
  now call recovered code. Insertion binds typed images, preserves size/colour
  call order, appends original list links and requests first-icon focus; the
  wrapper writes texture/dirty state. Native vector ownership remains a seam.
  See [insertion evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#icon-construction-insertion-and-texture-dispatch-2026-10-18).
- Selection label updates now call recovered `0x50da50`, using bound title
  +0x134 and description +0x138 objects. Named-string wrapper `0x4953c0`
  executes recovered hashing before typed string lookup. Native construction
  binds `ICON_TITLE` and the original empty-name description; localized string storage remains a seam. See [label evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#bound-scroller-labels-and-named-string-lookup-2026-10-18).
- Language-hash setter `0x50c900` now calls recovered code for both menu labels
  and the GPS label requests. Hash +0x60, dirty writes and observer notification
  follow the original. A native observer at `*0x838478` supplies language lookup
  and UTF-16 storage; string-manager internals remain a seam. The native loader
  preserves string SH hashes instead of overwriting +0x60 with a child count.
  See [setter evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#language-hash-setter-and-observer-notification-2026-10-18).
- Typed string/image lookup (`0x537a10`/`0x537a60`), generic wrapper `0x5379c0`,
  recursive object traversal and package-list fallback now execute recovered code.
  Native loading constructs root/child links; shown-screen membership and order,
  archive record construction, and the legacy `FngFindObject` adapter remain seams.
  Package locator `0x52cef0` now selects the two live lists or archive boundary
  through recovered code; the native demo initializes its mode flag to zero.
  Archive search `0x51bb70` also executes recovered code, including hash/header
  checks and list promotion. Native scaffolding still supplies shown-screen
  archive membership and simple hash records.
  See [lookup evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#object-tree-and-typed-package-lookup-2026-10-18).
- FEng (`0x537a10`, `0x50c900`, `0x537c00`/`0x537cc0`, `0x55dda0`, ...):
  packages are reloaded on every showing; messages are queued and delivered to the screen's object;
  scripts fire package events and the bounded animation tracks described in the settings pass below.
- Pause icon placement/reset/frame tick and cubic tweening now use recovered routines.
  Smaller icons centre-align; the icon row moves under a fixed selection frame, with placement
  preceding tween advancement. Native scroller construction remains a seam. Name selection `0x51cf70`,
  pointer assignment `0x5178b0` and track activation `0x517720` now use recovered
  code and arithmetic helpers; native loading supplies key nodes and event
  delivery observes the selected header. Playback clocks and event delivery
  remain seams. See [activation evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#script-selection-and-track-activation-2026-10-18).
  Colour, lock/arrow-script policies and scrollbar geometry use recovered routines;
  LOCK/BUTTON_MASTER and all ScrollBar objects now bind the retail objects.
  ScrollBar setup calls recovered constructor `0x542ac0`. See [placement evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#scroller-placement-and-cubic-tween)
  and run `python tools/smoke_native_pause_scroller.py` for rendered motion checks.
- Script hash selection `0x51cfe0`, package setters `0x537c00`/`0x537c60` and
  running queries `0x537cc0`/`0x537d40` now execute recovered code. Predicates read
  selected headers with signed inclusive time checks; native event-list queries
  and hash-selection loops are removed. HUD/Controls name selection also calls
  recovered code. Playback/event delivery remain seams.
  See [script wrapper evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#hash-selection-package-script-wrappers-and-running-queries-2026-10-18).
- Native package GUID/hash helpers now call recovered first-match tree queries
  (`0x517fe0`/`0x517f80`), replacing their flat-vector lookup loops. GUID callback
  `0x5048f0` compares object +0xc independently of the name hash. Native loading
  still supplies tree links and observed package prefixes.
  See [GUID lookup evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#guid-lookup-and-native-tree-adapters-2026-10-18).
- Response conditional traversal `0x504490` now executes recovered code over
  decoded 12-byte command records, including the original count boundary.
  Full response dispatch `0x52c7c0`, script lookup `0x5046b0`, focus cache
  `0x50b300`/`0x50b360` and stack reset `0x50b390` now execute recovered code.
  Message delivery `0x541fc0`, object delivery `0x5367e0`, and directional wrappers
  `0x51b000`/`0x52c750` now execute recovered code. Queued response masks are preserved.
  Native loading projects linked response prefixes and explicit Targ subscription rows.
  Operation consumer `0x5559c0` also executes recovered code. Package load/remove,
  four package-operation enqueue boundaries and the type 6 navigation mutator still
  trap; parser ownership, owner callbacks and registry data remain native.
  Type 4 navigation, offset setup, selection and motion now use recovered code
  over a native 0xac-byte prefix/axis-vector projection. Its allocator, cells,
  cell rendering and frame clock remain seams. Asset-free CTest `feng_list_native`
  checks the actual native parser through navigation and settling.
  See [list-state evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#list-setup-motion-and-native-projection-2026-10-18).
  Type 6 navigation and both gates are now recovered/verified with controlled
  refill interfaces. Production activation still needs the 0xc8-byte grid model
  and original owner behavior. Initial fill `0x504c40` is also recovered and
  verified, including cached extents/origins and reloaded callback targets and
  logical divisors; production reader/owner binding remains pending. No native
  cell-population algorithm is supplied. Asset-free CTest `feng_grid_native`
  exercises navigation and initial fill with synthetic virtual/cdecl callbacks.
  Grid resize `0x52bb30`, cell reset `0x504290` and logical dimension setters
  `0x518bb0`/`0x518c00` are recovered too. The native probe composes storage,
  fill and navigation with synthetic cells/pool data; native allocation/free
  are documented malloc/free seams. Production constructor/reader/owner binding
  remains pending; the type-6 navigation entry still traps.
  String-pool resize/migration `0x518c60` and rectangular cell setters
  `0x5196b0`/`0x5197d0`/`0x5198f0` are also recovered. The synthetic native probe
  checks UTF-16 truncation/rebinding and aliased pair writes; original reader
  composition, text assignment and owner population remain pending.
  The common FEng constructor `0x52af20` now executes in the native FNG loader,
  replacing whole-prefix zeroing and native GUID-zero defaults. Grid constructor
  `0x52b9e0` is recovered and composes with storage/fill/navigation in the asset-free
  probe; production type-6 construction/reader binding remains pending. Unknown
  base fields retain explicit native defaults, and native root/child chain links
  remain a loader seam. See [constructor evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#common-feng-and-grid-construction-2026-10-18).
  Type-6 property dispatch `0x535060` is recovered with its actual storage/pool
  and cell-property callees. The native component probe executes this reader;
  native chunk iteration/factory/owner binding still require recovery, so this
  does not activate production type-6 navigation or supply cell text population.
  Normal-return grid/base cleanup, pooled-state release and owned-list clearing
  are recovered and compose in the synthetic native probe. Production cleanup
  still uses native ownership: remaining virtual destructors, native state/factory
  integration and SEH unwind remain pending. See [lifecycle evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#normal-return-grid-and-object-cleanup-2026-10-18).
  State-pool acquisition and concrete block/class virtual destruction are also
  recovered. A synthetic native round trip allocates 40 slots across two blocks,
  distinguishes full-word class keys, and returns all storage through recovered
  release/cleanup. Fixed virtual slots are relocated only inside that test;
  production state/factory ownership binding remains pending.
  Name hashing `0x505450` now executes recovered source; the native hash loop is
  removed. See [grid/hash evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#type-6-grid-navigation-and-original-name-hashing-2026-10-18).
  See [message delivery evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#full-queued-message-delivery-2026-10-18).
  Native loading now selects/initializes Init as observed in the original readers. See [response evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#response-conditional-traversal-2026-10-18).
- GUI formatted hashing `0x50b9c0`, buffer wrapper `0x50c960`, shared profiling
  wrapper `0x43fbc0` and elapsed accounting `0x43e5c0` now execute recovered code.
  The buffer wrapper ignores capacity as the original does. Native SDL counter
  access/calibration remain platform seams.
  See [formatting evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#gui-formatting-wrappers-and-profiling-2026-10-18).
- Formatter core `0x43e950`, output helper `0x43cb40`, pointer validator
  `0x43bd60` and recursive vector wrapper `0x4400d0` now execute recovered code.
  The native host parser and temporary allocation are removed. Linux page-permission
  probes and SDL clock/calibration remain adapters; parser/string/locale data still
  bind the mapped reference image. Finite original/rebuilt verification covers
  bounded conversions, including custom vectors and fixed-point values; unsupported
  conversion-class paths remain unverified.
  See [core evidence and limits](pc-pause-menu.md#formatter-state-machine-recovery-2026-10-18).
- Message/input enqueue `0x51aa20`/`0x51af50` and removal `0x505400` now use
  recovered 32-byte nodes and separate linked lists. The native message vector
  is removed. Message/operation destructor bodies and payload cleanup are recovered;
  delivery and native cancellation call recovered message deletion. Native malloc/free,
  owner-to-screen delivery and deleting-vtable ABI bindings remain adapters.
  Asset-free queue integration is available as CTest `feng_queue_native`.
  See [queue/consumer evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#full-queued-operation-consumer-2026-10-18).
- FEng image centre/size writes and rendered text height now call recovered coordinate
  and metric routines. String and script-track prefixes expose the original offsets;
  position writes update live state and matching script baselines. Low-level font lookup,
  line measurement and script playback remain seams; see [coordinate evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#feng-coordinates-text-metrics-and-script-state).
- Icon selection now calls recovered `0x52f680`; indexed selection `0x52f7c0`, list
  helper `0x43be60` and focus-flag helper `0x51cc60` are recovered too. The embedded
  scroller has its complete observed 0xe8-byte extent, with native vector/ownership state
  stored separately. Focus flags and the saved scroller index are written by original
  code; scroller construction remains a seam. See
  [selection evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#icon-selection-and-the-full-scroller-layout).
- Icon stepping/indexing/selected-item dispatch now use recovered `0x51f9f0`, `0x51fac0`,
  `0x5276d0`/`0x527700`, `0x527730`/`0x527750`, `0x51f820` and `0x50d980`.
  The native scroller owns the original list/current-icon prefix; its constructor,
  construction and rendering remain seams. See [navigation evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#iconscroller-navigation-and-dispatch).
- Package masks, persisted selection and focus now use recovered routines `0x537950`,
  `0x50b8a0`/`0x50b8c0`, `0x52b3a0` and `0x52ce40`. Native screens retain FEPackage
  masks/focus/array offsets, archive-node package `+0x18` and a separate static FNG selection
  record. Object/record/archive loading and queue dispatch remain seams; see
  [package evidence](pc-pause-menu.md#feng-package-masks-selection-and-focus).
- FEng sprite rendering: the object quaternion is projected onto the screen plane, so the
  180-degree x/y turns UI_Pause uses to mirror frame corners and bar caps draw as mirrors; sprites
  with UVs inside [0,1] sample with GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE so linear filtering does not wrap edge texels.
- In-game dialog `0x558790`: two-button form of `UI_InGameDialog.fng` with the caller's labels,
  text and result messages; value `0x1C` is read as the initially highlighted button (Cancel).
- Game flow `0x5f4240`/`0x5f41e0`: messages 1/2 resume, 3 restarts like `R`, 6 (Quit to Main
  Menu) exits the demo, others resume with a log line. The replay
  screen is not available and resume the game. The PC help bar (`0x54e6a0`/`0x54e6e0`) is tracked,
  not drawn. Real clock `0x8651ac` advances at an assumed 4 kHz so `AcceptsInput` (`0x4a7bc0`)
  opens input one frame after the screen.
- The pointer table at `0x8900ac` shares the native HUD player slot, or a native
  fallback when the HUD is disabled, so `0x4a7bf0` offers Options.

Text justification (`Sj`) is read as flags from retail strings: bit 0 centres and bit 1
right-aligns (dialog button labels sit at their button centres with `Sj` 1; HUD speed digits
use 2). This corrected the native HUD's swapped centre/right handling.

`--pause-at N` opens the menu at frame N and `--pause-keys LRABUDS` presses left/right/accept/back/up/down/start
every 30 frames afterwards; finite `--frames` captures with `--pause-keys` ignore external
keyboard/mouse/controller UI actions while accepting the scripted input.
 `UG2_DEBUG_PAUSE=1` prints delivered messages and game-flow requests.

## Platform scaffolding (not original code)

`src/Platform/Native` contains everything that is not recovered UG2 code:

- `OriginalImage.cpp` maps the player's own `speed2.exe` `.rdata`/`.data` at their
  original addresses after a SHA-256 check; `OriginalSymbols.ld` binds recovered
  `extern` globals to those addresses. No original instruction executes.
- `NativeVehicle.cpp`: vtable shims forwarding each original slot to the recovered
  method, the `New...` allocation factories, the D3DX matrix multiply,
  scaffold race-status/context/random
  objects, keyboard capture, and the GLOBALB.BUN CarTypeInfo chunk kept resident
  and installed as original table pointer `0x8a1ccc` (the chunk loader is
  unrecovered). `CreateNativeVehicle` binds the tuning object to its car,
  selection and record (the original caller is unrecovered) and runs recovered
  composer `0x5b4dc0` in free-drive mode without the performance run: stock
  build, extras, tuning when active, drive curve and the original class index.
  The tuning-table loader is unrecovered, so no tuning entries are installed and
  full tuning does not run natively yet. See
  [physics parameter evidence](pc-physics-parameters.md).
- `DemoMain.cpp`: SDL2/OpenGL window and input; `NativeFng.cpp`/`NativeHud.cpp`: FNG HUD;
  `NativePause.cpp`: pause menu seams (see above); `NativeAssets.cpp`/
  `NativeScene.cpp` read and draw the original car and scenery assets (see above).
  `--placeholder` restores the box car and collision-polygon world.
- Unrecovered routines the demo state should never reach stop the program with a
  message instead of being stubbed (`NativeTrap`).

## Build and run

Requires i386 SDL2/GL runtime libraries and a multilib GCC.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/native && cmake --build build/native
build/native/ug2sim "Need for Speed Underground 2" SKYLINE 960   # headless check on L4RA
build/native/ug2probe -579.8 533.2                                 # collision coverage probe
build/native/ug2demo --car SKYLINE                                 # W/S/A/D, Space, R, Esc pause
build/native/ug2demo --frames 60 --orbit 30 --screenshot car.ppm   # scripted capture
build/native/ug2demo --frames 125 --pause-at 20 --pause-keys RRA --screenshot quit.ppm  # quit dialog
```

The headless Skyline run accelerates through automatic shifts near 7,800 rpm and reaches
about 95 km/h when its scripted steering takes it into the roadside wall at eight seconds,
where it now slides along the wall instead of leaving the map. These are plausibility
observations, not equivalence evidence.

## Known limitations

- Visible-section selection and the player-view flag test are applied (see
  [scenery visibility](#scenery-visibility-fourth-pass)). Pixel-size LOD `0x5d64d0`,
  the nearest-boundary fallback `0x5db770`, and view flags 0x02/0x01 remain unresolved.
  Blended draws are not depth-sorted; streaming, original shaders, and time-of-day
  colour selection remain unrecovered. Missing textures include 18 TRN_SH parts
  (`0x9c3ce745`) and four XS signs, as recorded in the scenery investigation.
- Paint, vinyls, damage textures and headlight/brakelight switching are not applied.
- Every collision pack is loaded at start-up
  instead of the original streaming. The spawn is the original start grid
  ([track markers](pc-track-markers.md)); the participant/car setup around it is native.
- Steering input scaling (±30° road-wheel angle), steering smoothing, device capture
  and partial controls construction are scaffold. Original pedal/reverse processing
  `0x407a30` and forward selection `0x407310` now run after native action capture;
  see [the substitute audit](demo-substitute-audit.md) for verification and remaining work.
- Native GCC x87 code is not bit-exact with MSVC; FPU control word is set to 0x027f.
- Free-drive race phase 0 is used; race-phase-dependent branches are untested.

## Outstanding recovery checks

- Extend collision verification to GJK `0x5b3390` and impulse resolution `0x5af0e0`;
  resolve the 42 degenerate simplex tie differences in `0x595040`.
- Recover car-vs-car/world-object paths (`0x5b31f0`, `0x5ae000`, slot 0x8c),
  cylinders (`0x5a23d0`, `0x5a2780`), and collision effects/sounds (`0x5a9620`, `0x59fb70`).
- Recover the enclosing car update `0x6012b0` and the original world-clock call site.
- Recover camera collision pushes/shake, the remaining car pre/post-update logic
  beyond the verified acceleration prefixes, remaining HUD inputs/features, and full
  FEng script playback/rendering. Additional HUD
  source recovery requires separate verification and integration evidence.
- A free/aerial camera remains useful for wider scenery checks.

For reproducible wall checks, run:

```sh
UG2_STEER=-0.4 UG2_DEBUG_COLLISION=1 build/native/ug2sim "Need for Speed Underground 2" SKYLINE 900
```

## UI fonts

FEng strings use the retail bitmap fonts, not GDI (the only `CreateFontA` caller, `0x70d5f7`, rasterises
an 8-pixel debug font). Each font is a `0x30201` chunk: name at +0, texture name at +0x100 and an
`FNTF` glyph table at +0x200. `LANGUAGES/English.bin` holds Conduit ITC 14i and 38bi, Arial, Arial 12,
Impact 36 and LCD 48 (textures in `LANGUAGES/LanguageTextures.bin`); `GLOBAL/GLOBALA.BUN` holds
Conduit ITC 21i with its texture. A string object's font is its package resource (object `+0x24`).

Followed from the retail code: font construction `0x51bdc0` (via the `0x30201` handler `0x52cd00`),
lookup `0x51bd70` with the substitute table `0x7f9184` (38bi falls back to 21i), the per-font
offset/leading table `0x7f918c`, string layout `0x51c110` with glyph quads `0x51bfc0`, glyph lookup
`0x4fda70`/`0x6f45b0`, kerning `0x6f45f0`, line width `0x50bce0`, text height `0x50bf40`, line
count `0x50c080` and `$token$` skipping `0x50ba70`/`0x50bac0`. 'Sj' justification, 'Sl' leading,
'Sw' wrap width and `^`/newline breaks follow those routines. 'SH' is a string label hash
(`0x534fc0` passes it to `0x4fe940`), not a font.

Seams: the font list, chunk loading and OpenGL drawing are native; the layout port is behavioural
and not byte-verified. Glyph UVs are inset by half a texel so bilinear filtering does not reach the
neighbouring glyphs of the packed texture. The string's size scales its FEng units, glyph colour
uses the image colour path, and the `0x100` flag argument of the glyph quad is ignored. Only
English fonts are loaded, so the language-suffix stripping of `0x51bdc0` is not needed. Text is
8-bit, widened to the retail 16-bit characters. Strings whose font is missing fall back to a system
italic sans face rasterised with the vendored `imstb_truetype.h` (public domain/MIT);
`--hud-font PATH` forces that TrueType face for all text.

## Optional native mods

Configure with `-DUG2_ENABLE_MODDING=ON` to build the separate native plugin loader.
The default build remains unchanged in scope. See [Native modding](../modding/README.md)
for SDK/lifetime rules, installation, load order and physics-provider contracts.
The bundled `widescreen_hud` plugin moves verified driving-HUD anchors outward
and retains the recovered 4:3 vertical view while widening horizontal FOV.
Use `--width W --height H`; `--no-mods` restores the original native presentation.
Rendering and debug picking share the adjusted projection. Recovered camera and
physics routines are unchanged. `original_physics` forwards to the recovered solver;
custom physics is supplied by third-party providers through documented native seams.

## In-game settings integration

The pause menu's Options item now opens the recovered Audio/Display/Gameplay/Player
category screen and recovered option handlers. The native demo supplies the unrecovered
list/widget bases using the player's retail FNG objects and scripts. See
[settings evidence and limitations](pc-pause-options.md) for the distinction between
verified original code and platform seams.

Use left/right for category and value changes, up/down (or W/S) for rows, Enter to
accept, Esc/Backspace to return, and P/Pause to resume from settings. Units and camera
choices feed the demo; audio, display backends, persistence and other gameplay setting
effects remain incomplete. Changes are session-only. Scripted keys also support U/D/S.

```sh
python tools/smoke_native_pause_options.py
build/native/ug2demo --frames 260 --pause-at 20 --pause-keys RAALDL --screenshot build/audio.ppm
```

The settings, Controls and scroller-motion Python smoke scripts default to
headless SDL `offscreen` rendering with software OpenGL. Their child processes
have `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` removed; no display server or Xvfb is needed
on the validated SDL/Mesa installation. The screenshot and pixel assertions still
run. Use `--game '/path/to/game'` and optionally `--demo '/path/to/ug2demo'` to
avoid a local asset symlink. `--headed` uses the inherited desktop configuration;
`--headless` explicitly selects the default. Systems without SDL offscreen OpenGL
support need the headed mode or an externally supplied display server. The demo
itself remains interactive by default. Emulation verifiers and `ug2sim` already
run without a display.

Generated screenshots for this pass: `build/analysis/native-options/{audio,display,gameplay,player}.ppm`.

The native slider fill and knob use the geometry read from retail `0x540d20`.
For the supplied frontend reference, the adapter reads the dark track tint from
retail `UI_Options.fng`; the pause package otherwise uses a white track. Arrows
appear on the selected slider. These visual choices are native presentation
seams; see `docs/pc-pause-options.md` for the original-code verification and
rendered slider checks.

The native pause/settings UI also accepts SDL gamepad and mouse input.
Start pauses, D-pad/left stick navigate, A accepts, B returns, and Y opens
Controls. Mouse clicks activate icons/rows, the wheel moves rows, and
right-click returns. Click or drag slider tracks to set values. Player → Controls
(or F2 while paused) opens the retail binding package. Tab, shoulders or device
arrows switch Keyboard/Gamepad for session rebinding. While driving, left stick
steers, right/left triggers accelerate/brake, A handbrakes, right-stick press
looks back, Y changes camera, Back resets, and Start pauses. Full support covers
the demo's existing actions; unrecovered gameplay actions remain unavailable. See [controls evidence and seams](pc-controls.md).
