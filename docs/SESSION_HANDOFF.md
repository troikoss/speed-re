# Session handoff — 2026-10-12

## Goal and standing instructions

Audit the native UG2 demo and replace every replaceable gameplay substitute
with original UG2 PC v1.2 code recovered from the supplied executable. Continue
through steering, vehicle/session construction, update timing, reset/camera,
HUD/frontend, and asset/world/presentation logic. Preserve necessary Linux
backends, verify recovered routines and integration, and document unresolved
dependencies and unavoidable platform seams.

The larger repository objective is a reverse-engineered SPEED engine, with
complete, verified, reproducibly buildable UG2 source as the first target; a
playable demo is intermediate. Completion evidence is defined in
`docs/DECOMPILATION_SCOPE.md`. Do not redefine completion around isolated tests.

The user requires verified changes to be committed and pushed between pauses.
Push authorization persists for `main` at
`https://github.com/troikoss/speed-re.git`; do not ask again. Do not commit retail
assets, executables, compiler binaries, or generated disassembly. Keep unverified
work clearly identified rather than describing it as a verified checkpoint.

Follow `AGENTS.md`: always recover original code, never invent replacement game
algorithms. Preserve arithmetic order, call boundaries, addresses and x86
layouts; keep unknown fields offset-based. Report behavioral equivalence
separately from byte matching. Native code uses C++11; recovered source must
also compile with MSVC 7.1. Run MSVC/wibo jobs sequentially. Do not spawn agents
unless the user or applicable repository/skill instructions request delegation.

## Authoritative checkpoint

Workspace: `/home/dq/Documents/Development/speed-re`, branch `main`.
Latest verified checkpoint: **Recover FEng language-hash setter and observer notification**
(see Git history for its commit). Navigation checkpoint: `c0b18f1`; package mask/focus
checkpoint: `3878b16`. Direct user authorization to commit and push to `main` was renewed on 2026-10-12. The preceding code checkpoint is `3e58488` — **Give native
FEng objects the original object and script prefix**.

Recovered and verified since the previous handoff (each with a Unicorn differential verifier and
mutation tests; byte matching not established):

- HUD: mask producer `0x600090` + helpers (`verify_pc_hud_player_masks.py`), gauge update
  `0x4c68d0`, map feature `0x4da640`, feature dispatch `0x4ec5a0`, career/language readers
  (`verify_pc_hud_freeroam.py`). Evidence: `docs/pc-hud-freeroam.md`.
- Start grid `0x5eb5d0` and track position markers (`verify_pc_track_markers.py`); the native
  spawn is now the original grid (smoke 46.6/15.8 km/h from the parking-bay start).
  Evidence: `docs/pc-track-markers.md`.
- Collision sound wrappers, game message post, profile readers, camera option step
  `0x5f2fa0`, game-event record/apply `0x578ef0`/`0x4a7b30`, transmission setter `0x407280`,
  replay camera score `0x578e90`, control mask, return package (`verify_pc_small_queries.py`,
  `verify_pc_replay_events.py`). Evidence: `docs/pc-collision-notifications.md`.
- Native player record and camera-mover seam live in `src/Platform/Native/NativePlayer.h`.

## Current focus: replace native pause-menu code with original code

The user asked to focus on the pause menu. `NativePause.cpp`/`NativePauseOptions.cpp` are mostly
a stand-in for the FEng UI engine plus native versions of original frontend classes. The original
classes write FEng internals directly, so the work is staged:

1. **Done (`3e58488`)**: native FEng objects keep the original FEObject prefix
   (`HudVisibilityObject` in `Hud/HudVisibility.h`: guid `+0xc`, hash `+0x10`, type `+0x18`,
   flags `+0x1c` (0x400000 dirty, 0x4000000 focus), texture `+0x24`, state block `+0x2c`
   (size at `+0x38/+0x3c`), script list `+0x4c`, current script `+0x54`) and the FEScript
   prefix (length `+0xc`, time `+0x10`, hash `+0x30`). The native script player runs on
   `currentScript54->time10`. HUD/pause frames byte-identical.
2. **Done**: native screens retain FEPackage masks `+0x1c/+0x20/+0x24/+0x28`, focus
   `+0x8c`, focusable-object array `+0x90`/count `+0x94` (flag 0x10000000, reader `0x555140`),
   archive node's package `+0x18` and manager's queue pointer `+8`. `FEngPackage.cpp` recovers
   mask setter `0x537950`, selection get/set `0x50b8a0`/`0x50b8c0`, focus setter `0x52b3a0`
   and hash focus `0x52ce40`. `verify_pc_feng_package.py`: 10,000 comparisons; four rejected
   source mutations. Native icon selection uses hash focus; option widget focus uses SetFocus.
   Focus notifications are queued before assignment. **Correction:** selection `+0x10` is
   in the static FNG record (table `0x7f7dc8`, lookup `0x50b840`), not the live package.
   Native package/archive/record lookups and queue dispatch remain seams, including unmodelled
   target -5 delivery. The global manager at `*0x8384c4` and original lookup lists are still
   unrecovered (`0x52cef0`, `0x51bb70`, `0x517f80`, `0x52c570`). Native build, pause verifier
   (11,723), options verifier (5,730) and all 19 native settings scenarios pass.
   Evidence: `docs/pc-pause-menu.md#feng-package-masks-selection-and-focus`.
3. **Navigation/dispatch done**: `IconScrollerNavigation.cpp` recovers `0x51f9f0`/`0x51fac0`,
   `0x5276d0`/`0x527700`, `0x527730`/`0x527750`, `0x51f820` and `0x50d980`. Native
   scroller retains the original prefix through `+0x34`, supplies icon +4 intrusive links,
   and uses recovered navigation/indexing/dispatch. Post-selection layout, construction,
   insertion and the remainder of the scroller still use native seams. The original wrap routine
   loops when every icon is disabled and disabled selection is disallowed; do not add a guard.
   `verify_pc_icon_scroller_navigation.py`: 34,670 comparisons, four rejected mutations;
   byte matching not established. Pause/options verifiers and all 19 native settings scenarios pass.
   **Selection/layout storage done**: `IconScrollerSelection.cpp` recovers `0x52f680`,
   `0x52f7c0`, and list `0x43be60`; FEng focus flag helper `0x51cc60` is stdcall (12-byte
   cleanup). Selection marks all icon objects before the disabled/same-item gates. Direct
   selection stores a 1-based index, indexed selection stores its zero-based input unchanged.
   Native selection now calls recovered SelectIcon. The complete scroller extent is 0xe8:
   ScrollBar +0x38, tween +0x90, alignment +0xc0, index +0xc8, window +0xcc, master +0xd4/+0xd8,
   running offset +0xe0 and fade +0xe4. Native ownership/vector state lives separately.
   The mapped manager pointer at 0x8384c4 is bound during native pause loading.
   `verify_pc_icon_scroller_selection.py`: 12,063 comparisons; four rejected mutations,
   package verifier now 12,000; native build and all 19 settings smoke scenarios pass.
   **Coordinate/state helpers done**: `FEngCoordinates.cpp` recovers `0x51d070`, `0x51d380`,
   `0x51d4d0`, `0x50cb00`, `0x5178d0`, `0x504500`, `0x5046f0`, `0x50bec0`, `0x50bf40`,
   `0x50c020`/`0x50c050` and glyph search `0x6f45b0`. Native image positioning/size and rendered
   text height call recovered code. Native strings retain text +0x64/justify +0x6c/leading +0x70;
   native scripts expose 0x38-byte track baselines. The state writer updates both first matching
   track per script and live state; it is not a deferred-only write. Selector byte +7 comes from
   cumulative FI value sizes or To; FI payload byte 7 is not the selector (loader `0x5515e0`).
   The full native package/script loader is still a seam. Font lookup `0x51bd70` and low-level
   line width `0x50bce0` remain controlled/native boundaries. `verify_pc_feng_coordinates.py`:
   24,024 comparisons under 53-/64-bit x87, five rejected mutations; byte matching unestablished.
   Native build, pause/options/HUD verifiers, 19 settings and 10 Controls smoke scenarios pass.
   Layout recovery must use top-left `0x51d070`/`0x51d380` versus centre `0x51d4d0` correctly.
   Alignment 1 in `0x52f8c0` appears centre-aligned; verify before replacing the old native
   bottom-alignment comment. `0x537a10` is a type-2 string lookup, not the generic native seam.
   **Placement/tween done**: `IconScrollerLayout.cpp` recovers `0x5748c0`/`0x574910`/`0x574e30`,
   `0x50d8d0`, `0x50d9c0`, `0x51fd60`, `0x52f8c0`, `0x538a30` and `0x538940`. Native direct
   layout is removed; reset and frame tick use original placement and cubic motion. Alignment 1
   is centre alignment (old native bottom-alignment comment was wrong). Positioning precedes
   tween advancement; reset selects only after placement. `ScrollerTween` is explicit at +0x90.
   Native frame delta binds `0x865198`; scroller relayout clock is `0x8641a0`. End-slope preserves
   inv-duration multiplication, and acceleration preserves original float spills at 0x574925/942.
   `verify_pc_icon_scroller_layout.py`: 14,762 comparisons, five rejected mutations; native
   19 settings, 10 Controls and regression verifiers pass. Motion is checked by
   `smoke_native_pause_scroller.py` (869 -> 758.5 -> 640 px). Finite scripted UI captures
   ignore external UI events/repeat to prevent desktop pointer interference; explicit script
   pointer/gamepad actions and normal interactive input remain supported.
   **Colour/lock policy done**: `FEngColour.cpp` and `IconScrollerScripts.cpp` recover
   `0x5054d0`, `0x50ccc0`, `0x495570`, `0x504640`, `0x517ad0`, `0x51d7f0`, `0x51d040`
   and `0x51df00`. Signed clamps and wrapping ±1 tolerance, first matching track per script,
   live state writes, channel alias/load/store order and inclusive script expiry are verified.
   `verify_pc_feng_colour_scripts.py`: 29,200 comparisons, five rejected mutations.
   Native colours delegate to recovered setter; LOCK/BUTTON_MASTER bind retail objects.
   Layout chain's 14,762 comparisons now execute real recovered colours and lock policy.
   Formatted hash `0x50b9c0`, script activation `0x51cf70`, scrollbar `0x538080` and
   arrows were subsequently recovered below. Native build, pause/options verifiers, 19 settings,
   10 Controls and rendered motion pass. Byte matching remains unestablished.
   **Arrows done**: `0x52fa70`, `0x527660`, `0x495810` preserve Static/Blink requests,
   helper call boundaries, inclusive expiry and first/last visibility early returns.
   ScrollBar exposes arrows +0x48/+0x4c and native construction binds retail
   ScrollBar_Arrow_1/2. Expanded colour/scripts verifier passes 39,700 comparisons
   (10,500 new), with five rejected arrow mutations; layout's 14,762 comparisons now
   execute actual recovered arrow code. Native build, 19 settings, 10 Controls and
   rendered motion pass. Scrollbar update and geometry/constructor remain seams.
   **Scrollbar geometry done**: `ScrollerScrollBar.cpp` recovers `0x538080`, `0x52e200`,
   `0x52e320`; coordinate helpers add `0x51d620`, `0x51d730`, `0x495590`, `0x525db0`.
   Preserve scaled step's extended reuse versus fixed step's rounded reuse, top-left versus
   centre placement, integer-page denominator in fixed mode and visibility order/hidden-branch
   preservation. `verify_pc_scroller_scrollbar.py`: 15,641 comparisons under 53-/64-bit x87,
   five rejected mutations (a forced volatile step spill is needed; a plain field reread is
   optimized back into x87 reuse). Coordinate verifier expands to 29,970; layout remains
   14,762 with actual scrollbar code. Native binds all six retail scrollbar objects and reads
   geometry via recovered getters. Full construction remains a seam. Native build, pause/options,
   19 settings, 10 Controls and rendered motion pass; byte matching remains unestablished.
   **Scrollbar constructor done**: `0x542ac0` and named image wrapper `0x4953e0`
   replace native setup. Preserve untouched +0x34/+0x3c fields, null-prefix lookup skip,
   six suffixes/order, noncanonical bytes and original opposite-axis initial scaled extent.
   Scrollbar verifier expands to 19,641 (2,000 constructors + 2,000 wrappers); five
   constructor/wrapper mutations rejected. Format `0x50c960`, hash `0x505450` and typed
   image lookup `0x537a60` remain controlled/native boundaries; type 1 is enforced natively,
   package/manager lookup and legacy truncation remain unverified. Native build, layout,
   pause/options and 19 settings/10 Controls/motion checks pass. Full scroller construction
   remains a seam. Default empty scrollbar ctor only supports temporary native storage.
   **Next**: recover the rest of IconScroller (vtable `0x79c0f4`, base `0x795cbc`, 0xe8 bytes at
   IconScrollerFNGObject `+0x4c`) replacing `NativeIconScroller`:
   ctors `0x543840`/`0x543a90`, slots `0x543bf0`,
   `0x538b80`, `0x51f870`; helpers `0x51fb70`,
   `0x538130`, `0x52e4e0`, `0x52e670`, `0x51fd10`, `0x51fd60`,
   list helper `0x43be80`; script activation `0x51cf70`/`0x517720`.
   Layout notes: `+4/+8` icon list sentinel (icon node at icon `+4`), `+0xc` current icon,
   `+0x10/+0x14/+0x18` OPTION/LOCK/BUTTON_MASTER objects, `+0x1c` package, `+0x20` "option_"
   prefix, `+0x24` spacing (40), `+0x28` next option number, `+0x2c` vertical, `+0x2e` relayout,
   `+0x30` allow disabled, `+0x34` last direction, `+0x38` ScrollBar (0x58), `+0x90` tween
   (0x30), `+0xc0` alignment, `+0xc8` selected index, `+0xcc` window width (480),
   `+0xd4/+0xd8` master position, `+0xe0` running offset, `+0xe4` fade flag.
   Icon (0x48, ctor `0x51f670`): `+0xc` texture, `+0x10` object, `+0x14` offset, `+0x1c`
   colour, `+0x20` disabled, `+0x24/+0x28` size, `+0x2c/+0x30` title/description,
   `+0x34..+0x44` fade state, `+0x45` reacts.
   **Input/deferred helpers done (2026-10-18)**: `IconScrollerInput.cpp` recovers
   storage `0x50da20`, stop/start `0x52fbf0`/`0x52fba0`; `FEngDiagnostic.cpp`
   recovers the retail no-op sink `0x50d510`. Native booleans are removed in favor
   of scroller +0x2f and owner +0x14c; package mask writes now follow the original.
   `verify_pc_icon_scroller_input.py --compiler clang-cl --mutation-checks`
   passes 10,800 comparisons and rejects five mutations. Native build, 19 settings
   and 10 Controls scenarios pass. MSVC 7.1/wibo is absent from this checkout;
   legacy-compiler validation and byte matching remain unestablished. Lookup
   `0x52cef0`, construction and message dispatch remain native seams.
   **Icon construction/insertion done (2026-10-18)**: `IconScrollerInsertion.cpp`
   recovers `0x51f670`, `0x543c10` and owner wrapper `0x50dab0`. Original partial
   initialization replaces native zeroing; insertion owns numbering, dimensions,
   colour writes, running offset, list links and initial focus. Native storage
   now retains only ownership/hit-test entries and the selected-index adapter.
   `verify_pc_icon_scroller_insertion.py --compiler clang-cl --mutation-checks`
   passes 6,000 comparisons under 53-/64-bit x87 and rejects six mutations.
   UI helper/deletion interfaces are controlled in that proof; native build,
   19 settings, 10 Controls and rendered scroller motion pass. MSVC and byte
   matching remain outstanding. Full scroller construction/destruction and
   owner dispatch remain seams. Native GUI smoke scripts now default to SDL
   offscreen software rendering, with `--headed` available; see NATIVE_DEMO.md.
   **Bound labels done (2026-10-18)**: `IconScrollerLabels.cpp` recovers
   `0x50da50` and named string lookup `0x4953c0`, executing the already recovered
   `cihash` at `0x505450`. Owner storage separates scroller +0x4c..+0x133 from
   title +0x134 and description +0x138. Native construction binds both original
   names (`ICON_TITLE` and empty), and no longer looks up just the title on every
   selection change. The label setter can change selection; the second read is
   retained. `verify_pc_icon_scroller_labels.py --compiler clang-cl --mutation-checks`
   passes 6,000 comparisons and rejects five mutations. Typed lookup and localized
   label storage remain controlled interfaces; full constructor recovery, MSVC
   verification and byte matching remain outstanding. Native build, 19 headless
   settings, 10 Controls and rendered motion pass; input/insertion regression
   verifiers and their mutations also pass. Next small target: setter `0x50c900`
   (hash +0x60, flags +0x1c, virtual observer through `*0x838478`), still native.
   **Language setter done (2026-10-18)**: `FEngText.cpp` recovers `0x50c900`,
   including unchanged-hash notification, incoming flag-bit snapshot and
   post-callback dirty/bit-2 handling. The shared object prefix exposes string
   language hash +0x60 as a union with group child count. Native loading preserves
   initial SH hashes; a native first-slot observer retains language lookup and
   UTF-16 ownership. The GPS caller's misleading native `HudObjectTexture`
   adapter is removed in favor of the recovered setter. `verify_pc_feng_text.py
   --compiler clang-cl --mutation-checks` passes 8,192 setter/composed-label
   comparisons and rejects six mutations. Freeroam HUD now supports explicit
   Clang fallback and passes 15,180 comparisons; that verifier still controls
   the setter. Native/mod builds pass. Original observer internals, localization,
   asset loading, MSVC validation and byte matching remain unestablished.
   Headless 19 settings/10 Controls, scroller motion and HUD aspect/skin captures
   pass with the new observer. Next bounded candidates: typed object lookups
   `0x537a10`/`0x537a60` and their `0x517f80`/`0x52c570` search dependencies,
   then script activation `0x51cf70`/`0x517720`.
4. Recover IconScrollerFNGObject: ctors `0x551de0`/`0x552330`, dtor `0x4defb0`, message handler
   `0x543d40` (sounds via table `0x837fe0` -> `0x458520`),
   `0x538c00`/
   `0x538ca0` (dim scripts on object `0x47ff4e7c`).
5. Then the options scroller and option items in `NativePauseOptions.cpp`, the in-game dialog
   `0x558790`, and game-flow queue `0x5f41e0`/`0x5f4240`.

Decompilations of the scroller set were saved under the session scratchpad (`scroller/`,
`feng/`); regenerate with ghidra-rpc if missing. Recreate missing Ghidra functions with
`create-function` first (several of these addresses were undefined).

## Other open work

- Native respawn (DemoMain airborne reset) is the remaining invented gameplay logic. The
  original reset `0x6009a0` (via fall check `0x5ecba0`) needs road navigation: `WRoadNav`
  (ctor `0x5da2f0` recovered; advance `0x5da370` -> `0x5d5c00`/`0x5d9e30`/`0x5da240`, spline
  helpers `0x570640`/`0x577710`) over the road network in `TRACKS/L4RA.BUN`: chunk `0x34107`
  (loader `0x5df8a0`, also `0x80034100` sub-chunks, table at `0x883df0`/`0x883df4`), `0x34108`
  (`0x5db2e0`, list `0x88f760`), `0x34110..0x34113` (`0x5def30` -> grid `0x88eb00` `0x5da7a0`).
  Loaders are registered by the static initializers at `0x77e7d0..0x77e8d0`.
- HUD caller `0x600590` (blocked on rear-view mirror view `0x5f1e10`), participant setup
  `0x6065b0`, car constructor `0x604260`, world update `0x609ce0`, asset chunk loaders.
- Earlier physics items (tuning-table loader, CarTypeInfo binding) remain as listed in
  `docs/demo-substitute-audit.md`.

Run the verifier commands sequentially because MSVC/wibo shares temporary
filenames. Local tools are `build/tools/wibo` and
`build/compilers/Win32/7.1/cl.exe`. Native32 execution requires escalation in this
sandbox; a sandbox exit 159 does not establish a native program failure.
Git mutations/push also require escalation because `.git` is sandbox read-only.
No analysis jobs are left running at this checkpoint.

24. **Object-tree and typed package lookup checkpoint (2026-10-18).**
    `FEngLookup.cpp` recovers visitor walks `0x504830`/`0x504880`, query
    `0x5048d0`, package object search `0x517f80`, signed ASCII name comparison
    `0x505310`, package-list search `0x519e50`, queue fallback `0x52c570`, and
    wrappers `0x5379c0`/`0x537a10`/`0x537a60`. This supersedes the lookup gaps
    listed above. Root/child links now feed recovered traversal; native screen
    membership/order and package locator `0x52cef0` remain seams. The legacy
    generic `FngFindObject` is still a compatibility adapter, not `0x537a10`.
    Clang i686 verification passes 11,264 comparisons with actual composed
    helpers and rejects six mutations. Package regression passes 12,000;
    native build, all 19 settings, all 10 Controls and motion pixel checks pass
    headlessly. Normal-return SEH-chain restoration is verified; exception
    unwinding, MSVC 7.1 and byte matching remain outstanding. See full evidence
    in `pc-pause-menu.md`. Next bounded candidates: package locator `0x52cef0`
    and archive search `0x51bb70`, then script activation `0x51cf70`/`0x517720`.

25. **Package locator checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FEngLocator.cpp` recovers
    `0x52cef0` (106 bytes): mode `0x8384d0` plus manager availability chooses
    live lists +0xdc/+0xec or archive node search. Live misses and a null live
    queue do not fall through to the archive. The native locator adapter is
    removed; native startup explicitly selects mode zero. Archive search and
    list membership/loading remain native seams. The extended lookup verifier
    now executes the actual locator in typed-wrapper compositions and controls
    only archive `FindNode` (plus direct-test visitor callbacks). It passes
    12,352 comparisons and rejects ten mutations; package regression passes
    12,000. Native/mod-enabled builds and headless 19 settings, 10 Controls and
    motion checks pass. See `pc-pause-menu.md` for validation and compiler limits. Next: archive search
    `0x51bb70`, whose hash match moves the node to the front of its intrusive
    list, then script activation `0x51cf70`/`0x517720`.

checkpoint. Reviewed revision `d238bdffc648498840d17133edb256fa0310d355`;
see `nfspluginsdk-reference.md` for pinned ProStreet FEng/script/string leads
and the MW05 virtual-layout difference. No source imported or UG2 fields
renamed from cross-title evidence alone.

26. **Archive search checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FEngArchive.cpp` recovers
    `0x51bb70` (206 bytes): nullable length/hash, backward backslash scan,
    two record formats, first hash hit and ordered unlink/prepend. Leading
    backslash and zero-candidate behavior are preserved. Native `FindNode` is
    removed; native shown-screen membership and hash-record construction remain
    seams. Standalone Clang i686 verification passes 8,192 comparisons and
    rejects six mutations, including exact link-write order and repeated calls.
    The lookup verifier's `--compose-archive` mode executes the real archive
    dependency and passes 13,376 comparisons, rejecting the ten existing
    lookup/locator mutations. Native/mod builds and headless all 19 settings,
    all 10 Controls, slider pixels and motion checks pass. Legacy compiler/byte matching,
    arbitrary malformed lists and archive lifecycle remain unverified. Next:
    script activation `0x51cf70`/`0x517720`; tracing shows name hashing on each
    search iteration and script-current-pointer reload after activation.

27. **Script selection/activation checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FEngScript.cpp`
    recovers name selection `0x51cf70`, pointer assignment `0x5178b0`, track
    initialization `0x517720`, reference resolver `0x4fe890`, quaternion helper
    `0x4fe6b0` and integer helper `0x505580`. Byte restart signature replaces
    provisional bool. Actual helper composition passes 14,336 Clang i686
    comparisons at x87 53/64-bit precision and rejects nine mutations. Aliased
    current-script reload and helper output aliasing are checked; special float
    values, arbitrary aliasing and byte matching remain unestablished.
    Native name adapter/hash map removed; native loader owns delta-key prefixes
    per reader `0x5515e0` and event cursors follow selected headers. Hash/package
    wrappers, script-running predicates, allocation and playback remain seams.
    Native/mod builds and final headless all 19 settings, all 10 Controls,
    slider pixels and scroller motion pass after event-observer integration.
    Next candidates: hash selector `0x51cfe0`, wrappers `0x537c00`/`0x537c60`, predicates `0x537cc0`/
    `0x537d40` and original playback/update dependencies. Do not confuse pointer
    setter `0x5178b0` with the native hash-selection adapter.

28. **Hash selection and package script wrappers (2026-10-18).** Hash selector
    `0x51cfe0`, setters `0x537c00`/`0x537c60` and predicates `0x537cc0`/
    `0x537d40` now use recovered code. Keep low-byte restart, null selector calls,
    formatter-after-lookup order, current-header reload after formatting, and
    signed inclusive time checks. Native hash loops/event-list predicates and
    the unused frontend script adapter are removed; HUD/Controls name calls
    also use the recovered selector. Selector suite passes 16,384 Clang i686
    comparisons at 53/64-bit precision and rejects ten mutations. Full
    `--compose-scripts` lookup passes 17,472 comparisons; only formatted hashing
    and direct visitor callbacks are controlled; seventeen mutations are rejected.
    Native/mod builds, all headless 19 settings/10 Controls, motion and HUD
    captures (four ratios, eleven skins, 120 frames) pass. See `pc-pause-menu.md` for
    coverage and remaining compiler/byte-match limits. Next bounded leads:
    formatted hash `0x50b9c0` and its profiled formatting boundary `0x43fbc0`,
    then command execution `0x52c7c0` and original playback/update dependencies.

29. **GUI formatting/profile checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FEngFormatting.cpp`
    recovers `0x50b9c0` inline formatted hash and `0x50c960` capacity-ignoring
    variadic forwarding. Engine `Libs/bWare/Formatting.cpp` recovers profile
    wrapper `0x43fbc0` and elapsed accounting `0x43e5c0`, including low-byte
    saturating signed shift, wrapped/clamped low-word delta, signed scale factor,
    callback-visible total and wrapping count. Native old wrappers removed;
    `NativeFormatting.cpp` supplies SDL clock/calibration and host memory-sink
    formatting at the unrecovered `0x43e950` core boundary. Standalone Clang
    verification passes 8,192 comparisons at 53/64-bit x87 precision and rejects
    ten mutations; full `--compose-formatting` lookup/script composition passes
    17,472 and rejects seventeen existing mutations. Compiler-runtime shift
    helper `0x75c600` is reference-executed where needed, not engine recovery.
    Native/mod builds and all headless 19 settings/10 Controls, slider pixels
    and scroller motion pass. Original core formatting, profiling initialization/units, special/failure
    behavior, legacy compiler and byte matching remain unresolved. Next leads:
    formatter state machine `0x43e950` and sink helper `0x43cb40`, then native
    response execution/playback. See `pc-pause-menu.md` for evidence and limits.

30. **Formatter sink checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FormattingSink.cpp` recovers
    `0x43cb40` (130 bytes) with entry-mode-dependent count order, forward copying,
    per-byte ring/memory mode reload and cached ring-index publication. 4,096
    Clang i686 comparisons check exact ordered writes and selected aliases;
    six mutations are rejected. Native/mod builds, all headless 19 settings/10
    Controls, slider pixels and motion checks pass. Native host formatting now emits temporary
    output through the recovered helper; parser/allocation and conversion/output
    interleaving remain seams. Full core `0x43e950` spans through `0x43f5d9`.
    `probe_pc_format_core.py` records 70 original-only cases (35 at each x87
    precision), controlling only pointer validation `0x43bd60`. The probe observes
    `%b`, `%z`, default three-place floats and three-digit scientific
    exponents; static tracing identifies `%v2`/`%v3` separately. See evidence
    for the `%.0z` edge case and packed table `0x786cf0`.
    Do not treat the probe as recovered-source verification. Pointer validator's
    IsBadReadPtr/IsBadWritePtr semantics and full state machine remain next.


31. **Formatter core checkpoint (2026-10-18).** `FormattingCore.cpp` recovers
    core `0x43e950`, validator `0x43bd60` and recursive `bSFormat` `0x4400d0`.
    Native host parser/allocation removed; packed table, locale and string data
    still bind the reference image. Linux permission probes and SDL clock are
    documented platform adapters. Clang i686 passes 6,534 comparisons across
    memory/count-only/ring at both x87 precision settings, including recursive
    vectors, fixed-point, special floats and selected `%n` aliases; eight
    mutations rejected. Only Win32 pointer probes and clock imports are
    controlled; CRT conversion/shift helpers reference-execute where emitted.
    Unsupported conversion-class paths retain unset/prior size and are excluded;
    arbitrary overflow/aliasing, FP flags, MSVC and byte matching remain open.
    See `pc-pause-menu.md` for exact evidence, commands and platform seams.
    Native/mod builds and headless 19 settings/10 Controls, slider pixels,
    scroller motion and mod HUD four-ratio/11-skin/120-frame checks pass.
    Next GUI targets remain response execution `0x52c7c0`, playback/update and
    lifecycle dependencies; do not infer them from the now-recovered formatter.
    Bounded next lead: original conditional skip helper `0x504490` spans 105
    bytes through `0x5044f8`, takes response layout count +0x10/commands +0x14,
    and returns with `ret 4`. Native `SkipBlock` currently uses `index < count-1`
    where the original loop tests `index < count` after reading/incrementing.
    Preserve the reference boundary (including its possible extra record read)
    when recovering it; source/decompile resemblance is not verification.
